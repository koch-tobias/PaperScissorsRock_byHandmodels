# PaperScissorsRock_byHandmodels
This project contains the source code and scientific work for the master project Explainable Machine Learning (xAI-Proj-M) at the University of Bamberg. 

The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning application considering the three steps Data Engineering, ML Model Engineering and ML Model Evaluation, which are part of the Deep Learning Life Cycle.
A separate research question is processed for each step but our overall goal is to develop ...
